    <p>Ice Hockey in the National Hockey League has been around for exactly a hundred years. That means that in 1917, The NHL formed to host the world's best teams that comprise of the world's best players. In order to really appreciate the grandeur of the sport, it's imperative that one comprehends the rules, mechanics, and semantics of hockey. For now, it is enough to begin with the mechanics and goals of the game.</p> <!--My typical paragraph tag. -->

      <dt><strong>Ice Hockey</strong></dt>
      <dd>A fast-paced contact sport played on ice. It's purpose is to deliver a puck within the net of the opposing team to score a goal. The team with the most goals win the game. Each team is formed with four line-ups consisting of five players on each line. These lines can substitute the other as long as there are five players on the ice consistently when a player makes any contact with the puck. </dd>

    <p>The listed description above are some of the primary rules and regulations of ice hockey. If these rules are broken at any moment within a game, the player that broke the rule will be penalized within the box accordingly. With these rules in place, the sport of hockey was ready to be published. An upcoming rise of hockey fever with the formation of a new league was inevitable. </p> <!--My typical paragraph tag. -->

    <p>After the National Hockey of Association (NHA) collapsed, the NHL was formed to replace it. In 1942, the NHL consisted of only six teams that are commonly known today as the 6 original teams of the league: the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, and Detroit Red Wings.</p> <!--My typical paragraph tag. -->

    <p>With these teams slowly picking up popularity, the NHL desired for a television contract extending the the United States. To do so, they expanded their capacity by adding six U.S. based teams which caused outrage from canadien fans. By 1974, The NHL enlisted another 6 teams for expansion, totaling 18 NHL teams. The future looked bright for the NHL and its owners, considering the fact that they continued to consistently expand and attract new fans. However, there was still an issue that NHL had to evaluate in their formula for success. There is a rivalry in the sport of ice hockey, threatening to persue the popular number one spot for die-hard fans: the World Hockey Association who vigorously fought to steal players from the open market.</p>

    <p>The WHA attempted to strangle the NHL by paying players more than the NHL owners, establishing teams in the western North America and mid-center Canada which areas NHL lacked in, and signing an barrage of European players to solidify their diversity of skills and styles of competition within their league. This made roughly 70 players form the NHL to transfer over to the WHA. Unknowingly, the WHA were characteristically ambitious and careless, which resulted in depletion of revenue with gross player salaries and the costs of constant team relocation, often completed mid-season. It was a sigh of relief for NHL owners when the WHA dissolved in 1969, due to a merger-deal with the NHL that granted them teams like additional teams like the famous Edmonton Oilers, Quebec Nordiques, and Winnipeg Jets. This was a major growth for the NHL and a successful opportunity to dominate in the market as the best league in the world.

      When the NHL signed top notch players and legends like Bobby Hull with a 2.75 million dollar contract with the Winnipeg Jets, they found another missing piece to the puzzle. It was time for the NHL to participate internationally, for a borader scope of viewers that advertised their business globally. They tested their fire power by participating in the Summit Series in 1972. It was the gladiator matchups between the Canadiens of the NHL and the Soviet Unions which produced good headlines in the papers. The win by the Canadiens of the NHL with four wins and three losses propelled the stardom of players and the revolution of the growing league. </p> <!--My typical paragraph tag. -->
